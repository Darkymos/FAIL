# FAIL
### short for Fast Amazing Intelligent Language

Interpreted language written in [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/). Currently not finished, development continues though.
A compiler may follow in the future.

It's main aim is a OOP-language with a type system and runtime safety as all errors should be catched at compile-time. 
For a later compiler, a memory system comparable to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) will be implemented to avoid using manual allocations or a `Garbage Collector`.
It could end up as a `Rust` with `OOP`, like `C++` compared to `C`, but with C# syntaxes and a bunch of own ideas.

Feel free to use and report issues!
